# Express.js Route Handler Missing Error Handling for Invalid User ID

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers: the lack of proper error handling for invalid input.  Specifically, this example shows a route that fetches a user by ID, but fails to handle cases where the ID is not a valid number.  This can lead to unexpected behavior or crashes.

## Bug

The `bug.js` file contains an Express.js route that retrieves a user by ID.  However, it doesn't handle the scenario where the provided ID is not a number.  This can result in errors if a user attempts to access a route with an invalid ID.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version of the route handler.  It includes explicit checks to ensure the ID is a number before attempting to access the user data.  It also includes comprehensive error handling, returning appropriate HTTP status codes in case of failure.
